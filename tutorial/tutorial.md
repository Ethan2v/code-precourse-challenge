# Code 1.0 Precourse Challenge

This tutorial is intended to explain how to complete the Code 1.0 cyber security
challenge. It is not, however, a fully-complete tutorial on the Python language.
For simplicity, this tutorial will guide you through one possible path to the
solution. We have pulled together all the information you need in this document.

More complex concepts which may have taken more time to explain and comprehend
have been ignored or avoided. You will be expected to learn languages at a
deeper level during the Code 1.0 class, but for now we’ll keep it simple. There
is no reason for you not to succeed with this challenge, even if you are a
complete beginner, if you follow this guide.

**You can do this!**
